# Full Stack API Final Project


## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.


## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is designed with some key functional areas:

### Backend
The [README within ./backend for more details](./backend/README.md) directory contains the completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

### Frontend

The [./frontend](https://github.com/udacity/FSND/blob/master/projects/02_trivia_api/starter/frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. If you have prior experience building a frontend application, you should feel free to edit the endpoints as you see fit for the backend you design. If you do not have prior experience building a frontend application, you should read through the frontend code before starting and make notes regarding:

1. What are the end points and HTTP methods the frontend is expecting to consume?
2. How are the requests from the frontend formatted? Are they expecting certain parameters or payloads? 

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API. The places where you may change the frontend behavior, and where you should be looking for the above information, are marked with `TODO`. These are the files you'd want to edit in the frontend:

1. *./frontend/src/components/QuestionView.js*
2. *./frontend/src/components/FormView.js*
3. *./frontend/src/components/QuizView.js*


By making notes ahead of time, you will practice the core skill of being able to read and understand code and will have a simple plan to follow to build out the endpoints of your backend API.
